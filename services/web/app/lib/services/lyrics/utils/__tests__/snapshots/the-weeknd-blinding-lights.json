From 2015 to 2019 Abel and model Bella Hadid had an on and off relationship, and after spending a few months apart, Abel seems to have lost his ability to love.\n\nTo add on, throughout After Hours, Abel plays with the idea of being “alone together” or simply “alone” on songs like “Save Your Tears”, “Faith,” and the opening track “Alone Again:”\n\n‘Cause I don’t know if I can be alone again\nI don’t know if I can be alone again",

							"text": "This line has several meanings:\n\nFirst, he alludes to Las Vegas again. As mentioned in the pre-chorus of the song, Abel has a special emotional connection to the city. He recalls it here and automatically combines it with the chorus:\n\nNo, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n\nFurthermore, Vegas is a city, known for being “alive” at night. Another reason this song’s story, or the whole album takes place in Vegas are Abel’s\nrepeated references of it, adding to the fact, that he feels at home there.\n\nAbel fears, that he won’t be able to sleep, because he lost his loved one and needs to get her back to finally get sleep. At the end of his journey, he recalls this line. On “Final Lullaby”, the last track off the deluxe version of his album After Hours, Abel tries to accept the fact that he won’t find his love back in that night.\n\nI’m running out of time\nAnd you’ll always be on my mind\n\nAnother explanation could be his habit to be awake late at night, as already mentioned in “Alone Again”:\n\nI’m falling only for the night\n\nA possible reason for him being stressed during the day is his fame and popularity. During the day, Abel is blinded by the lights of police cars, but also by flashing camera lights, representing fame. Therefore, he likes to escape into the night, just like in his record “Snowchild”:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh",
