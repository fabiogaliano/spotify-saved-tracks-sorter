It’s about keeping your true self hidden because opening up feels scary.\nimagine masking your true self so much to the point where u are literally afraid to love, afraid of that heart inside YOUR CHEST.

In this song, she gives a different perspective to Fender’s original lyrics. This reflects their different attachment styles: Fender being avoidant.\n\nShe believed the relationship to be doing well and it seemed to her that he got cold feet out of nowhere, without offering her a proper explanation. This perspective speaks of someone being left in the dark, and maybe not fully understanding their partner’s feelings. She comes to a conclusion that they ended the relationship as he was ’scared to be held’, inferring that he was not really ready for a relationship. She sees this as a poor way to end the relationship: it was the ’easiest way out’.",
