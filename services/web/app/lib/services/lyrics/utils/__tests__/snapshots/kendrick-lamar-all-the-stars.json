Tupac, one of Kendrick’s most noted influences, is often credited with the saying: “the realest people don’t have a lot of friends.”\n\nThis also relates to the Black Panther film since the main protagonist T'Challa had a small circle of people his trusted: his sister Shuri, his love interest Nakia, and his friend Okoye.",

This sentiment also applies to Kendrick’s life; he owns up to all his mistakes and victories–just as his momma raised him–and in doing so, he’ll always remain “the realest shit.”\n\nIn addition to this being a reference to taking an oath, this is added significance as a reference to Ramonda, T'Challa’s trusted confidant, adviser, and stepmother from Black Panther lore.",

							"text": "SZA’s chorus invokes the feeling of “reaching for the stars” to achieve your dreams and/or chase success. The chorus also contains thematic connections to Black Panther comic book lore.\n\nStars are often symbolic of past spirits or supernatural beings watching over us. The Black Panther can commune with all previous Black Panther spirits to draw on their knowledge and expertise. Only the current Black Panther can do this, bringing him closer to his ancestors and their wisdom.\n\n\n\nAs part of his initiation into the role of the Black Panther, T'Challa is required to meet Bast the Panther Goddess. During T'Challa’s quest, Bast appears to T'Challa in his dreams. The powerful goddess Bast stood and asked T'Challa what his true desires were. He responded by stating that he wanted to serve his people, but he will be whatever Bast wants him to be. Bast then dubbed T'Challa her personal Black Panther and crowned him king of Wakanda’s Dead City. She referred to him as “King of the Dead” and stated that he will have the strength and knowledge of every Wakandan king laid to rest in the Necropolis.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther is the final movie before Avengers: Infinity War, a movie in which all of Marvel’s superheroes come together from every corner of the universe to fight their greatest adversary. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is finally shrinking, and bringing all the loose ends together.",
