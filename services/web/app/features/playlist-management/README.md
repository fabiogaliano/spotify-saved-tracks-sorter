# Playlist Management Feature

## Overview

The Playlist Management feature provides a UI for users to view, manage, and interact with Spotify playlists. It handles two distinct types of playlists: AI-enabled playlists (flagged for sorting) and regular playlists. The feature includes functionality for viewing playlist details, tracks, syncing with Spotify, and enabling AI-based sorting.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

The playlist management feature follows a hierarchical component structure:

```

## Data Flow

1. The `PlaylistManagement` component receives a single array of all playlists
2. The `usePlaylistManagement` hook filters playlists based on tab selection (AI vs regular) and search criteria
3. Track data flows through the `PlaylistTracksContext` which provides methods for loading and retrieving tracks
4. The `usePlaylistTracks` hook provides formatted track data and loading methods
5. Individual components consume this data and render the appropriate UI

## Key Implementation Details

### Playlist Types

The system handles two types of playlists:

1. **AI-Enabled Playlists**: 
   - Have flags for AI processing (`is_flagged: true`)
   - Shown in the "is_flagged" tab

2. **Regular Playlists**: 
   - Standard playlists (`is_flagged: false`)
   - Shown in the "others" tab

**Note:** All playlists now load their tracks on-demand when selected, improving initial load performance.

### Track Data Handling

Track data handling is a critical part of the system and includes special case handling:

```typescript
const formatTrackData = useCallback((track: any) => {
  // Handle different track data formats (API vs UI)
  // If the track already has the right format properties, just ensure date formatting
  if (track.title) {
    return {
      ...track,
      dateAdded: track.addedAt ? formatDate(track.addedAt) : (track.dateAdded || 'Unknown'),
      rawAddedAt: track.addedAt || track.rawAddedAt || ''
    };
  } 
  // If the track has API format properties, use mapTrackToUIFormat
  else if (track.name || track.spotify_track_id) {
    const mappedTrack = mapTrackToUIFormat(track);
    // Also add the raw date for hover functionality
    return {
      ...mappedTrack,
      rawAddedAt: track.added_at || ''
    };
  }
  // Fallback for unknown format
  return {
    id: track.id || track.spotify_track_id || 'unknown',
    title: track.title || track.name || 'Unknown Title',
    artist: track.artist || 'Unknown Artist',
    album: track.album || 'Unknown Album',
    dateAdded: track.dateAdded || (track.addedAt ? formatDate(track.addedAt) : 'Unknown'),
    rawAddedAt: track.rawAddedAt || track.addedAt || track.added_at || ''
  };
}, []);
```

This function handles multiple potential data formats:
- UI format (with `title` property)
- API format (with `name` or `spotify_track_id` properties)
- Unknown format (with fallback values)

### Date Formatting

Date handling includes two representations:
1. **Relative dates** (`dateAdded`): Shows human-readable format like "Today", "Yesterday", "2 weeks ago"
2. **Raw dates** (`rawAddedAt`): Stores original date string for tooltip display on hover

### Loading States

Track loading states are now handled consistently for all playlist types:

```typescript
const isLoading = getLoadingStateForPlaylist(selectedPlaylist || '');
```

- All playlists show loading indicators when their tracks are being fetched
- The loading state is also used to disable sync buttons during track loading operations

## Context Management

The `PlaylistTracksContext` provides a centralized store for track data and loading states:

- Tracks are stored by playlist ID
- Loading states are tracked per playlist
- Methods for loading, retrieving, and formatting tracks are provided

## Hooks Overview

### usePlaylistManagement

The main hook managing playlist selection, tab navigation, and filtering:

- Handles selected playlist and tab state
- Provides filtered playlists based on search query
- Manages the currently displayed playlist details

### usePlaylistTracks

Manages track data loading and formatting:

- Interfaces with PlaylistTracksContext
- Handles track format normalization
- Provides loading states for playlists

### useSyncPlaylists

Handles syncing playlists with Spotify:

- Manages the global syncing state
- Provides methods for syncing individual playlists

### useNotifications

Provides notification functionality:

- Manages notification messages
- Provides methods for showing success/info messages

## UI States

The component handles multiple UI states:

1. **Loading**: Shown when tracks are being loaded for non-AI playlists
2. **Not Started Sync**: When a playlist hasn't been synced yet
3. **Failed Sync (Empty)**: When sync failed and no tracks are available
4. **Failed Sync (With Tracks)**: When sync failed but some tracks are available
5. **Normal Tracks View**: Shows the track table when data is available

## Special Considerations

### AI vs Regular Playlist Differences

- **Filtering**: Playlists are filtered on the frontend based on their `is_flagged` property
- **UI Indicators**: AI playlists show AI-specific UI elements and flags
- **Feature Access**: AI-specific features (like re-sorting) are only available for AI playlists
- **Loading Behavior**: All playlists now load tracks on-demand for better performance

### Track Data Format Handling

The system needs to handle different data formats:

- Spotify API's track format
- Internal UI track format
- Edge cases with missing data

The `formatTrackData` function handles these conversions, ensuring consistent display regardless of the source.
