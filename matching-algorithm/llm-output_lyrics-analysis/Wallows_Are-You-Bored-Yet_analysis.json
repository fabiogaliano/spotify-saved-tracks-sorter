          "description": "The primary theme revolves around the anxieties and uncertainties within a young relationship. The lyrics explore the fear of boredom, the reluctance to confront difficult emotions, and the potential for the relationship to become a regretful memory. The song captures the internal conflict of wanting the relationship to work while simultaneously questioning its longevity and the individual's own feelings.",

          "The song is about the fear of wasting time in a relationship that might not last.",
