        "name": "primary theme",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "evidence": ["specific lyric or section that supports this theme"],
        "variations": ["related themes or alternative interpretations"]
      }

}

Important guidelines:
- Only include themes that are clearly supported by the lyrics
- Each theme must have explicit evidence from the text
- Confidence scores should reflect the strength of available evidence
- Include only verified artist interpretations that are directly quoted
- Focus on themes that recur or develop throughout the song
- Consider both literal and metaphorical meanings where clearly present
- Analyze how verified themes connect to each other
- When in doubt, exclude themes rather than speculate

Please provide your analysis solely as valid JSON format only, nothing more.
