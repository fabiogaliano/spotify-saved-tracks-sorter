# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to improve the code organization and maintainability of the Spotify Auto Sort Liked Songs application.

## Key Changes

1. **Feature-First Architecture**

   - Restructured the codebase around features instead of technical concerns
   - Created dedicated feature directories for auth, tracks, playlists, analysis, and matching

2. **Improved Component Organization**

   - Moved UI components to a shared directory structure
   - Organized components by domain (tracks, home, auth)
   - Created clear separation between UI components and business logic

3. **Enhanced Core Infrastructure**

   - Moved domain models, repositories, and services to a lib directory
   - Created clear boundaries between data access and business logic
   - Separated state management into dedicated stores

4. **Better Route Organization**

   - Restructured routes to follow a more logical hierarchy
   - Moved authentication routes to a dedicated directory
   - Simplified route components to focus on composition

5. **Path Alias Improvements**

   - Added specific path aliases for each major directory
   - Simplified imports with clear, consistent patterns
   - Reduced complexity of relative imports

6. **Documentation**
   - Added README files to explain the purpose of each directory
   - Documented architectural principles and conventions
   - Created guidelines for future development

## Benefits

- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to locate code by feature
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: More intuitive organization
- **Easier Onboarding**: Clearer structure for new developers
- **Scalability**: Structure supports adding new features
- **Reduced Coupling**: Dependencies are more explicit

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of all files to the new structure
2. Update all import paths to use the new organization
3. Create interfaces for key abstractions
4. Add tests for core functionality
5. Standardize error handling across the application
