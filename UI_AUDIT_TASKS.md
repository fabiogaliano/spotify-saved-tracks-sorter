# UI/UX Audit & Enhancement Tasks

## üéØ Project Overview

This document contains comprehensive UI/UX improvement tasks for a React Router v7 application built with shadcn/ui components. The audit identified critical spacing issues, layout inconsistencies, and component integration problems that affect visual hierarchy and user experience.

**Primary Issues Identified:**
- **Spacing Problems**: "Your Playlists" title and count tag are touching without margin (SectionTitle component)
- **Component Duplication**: TrackAnalysisModal rendered twice in LikedSongsTable
- **Layout Inconsistencies**: Mixed table implementations and padding patterns
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile table experience needs improvement

## üìö Reference Guide

### Project Structure Analysis
- **Components Path**: `~/shared/components/ui/` (shadcn components)
- **Feature Components**: `~/app/features/[feature]/components/`
- **Main Routes**: `~/app/routes/`
- **Playlist Management**: `~/app/features/playlist-management/`
- **Theme System**: Custom design tokens in `app/tailwind.css`

### Critical Issues Summary

#### 1. SectionTitle Spacing Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `app/features/playlist-management/components/ui/controls.tsx:26-40`
**Problem**: Title and count badge have no margin separation - they are touching
**Root Cause**: Missing gap/spacing between flex items in the container

#### 2. Component Duplication (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `app/features/liked-songs-management/LikedSongsTable.tsx:254-262 & 416-424`
**Problem**: TrackAnalysisModal component is rendered twice
**Impact**: Performance and potential state management issues

#### 3. Table Implementation Inconsistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Locations**: 
- `LikedSongsTable.tsx` uses `px-4 py-3` padding
- `TableElements.tsx` uses `p-2` padding
**Problem**: Different padding patterns between similar table components

### shadcn/ui Best Practices Reference

#### Proper Component Variants
- **Button sizes**: `sm` (h-8), `default` (h-9), `lg` (h-10)
- **Card structure**: Card > CardHeader/CardContent/CardFooter
- **Spacing tokens**: Use `gap-*`, `space-*`, `p-*`, `m-*` classes

#### Tailwind Spacing Scale (4px increments)
- `gap-1` (4px), `gap-2` (8px), `gap-3` (12px), `gap-4` (16px)
- `gap-6` (24px), `gap-8` (32px), `gap-12` (48px)

#### Responsive Patterns
- Mobile-first: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Grid responsive: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-12`
- Flex direction: `flex-col md:flex-row`

#### Typography Hierarchy
- Section titles: `text-lg font-bold`
- Card titles: `font-semibold`
- Body text: `text-sm text-muted-foreground`

### Theme Integration Requirements
- Use CSS custom properties: `var(--color-*)`
- Light/dark mode support via `.dark` class
- Consistent border radius: `var(--radius)`
- Color semantic naming: `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`
